## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: CourtListener is sole data source (CAP API shut down Sept 2024)
- [Roadmap]: Streamable HTTP primary transport, SSE as fallback only (SSE deprecated March 2025)
- [Roadmap]: Citation parsing is local normalization only; CourtListener citation-lookup handles server-side Eyecite parsing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CourtListener rate limits (5,000/day free, 5,000/hour auth) may constrain testing; contact Free Law Project for production quota
- Quote verification fuzzy matching thresholds need experimentation in Phase 5
